    "The task of comparing two groups of text is fundamental to textual analysis. There are innumerable applications: survey respondents from different segments of customers, speeches by different political parties, words used in Tweets by different constituencies, etc. In this assignment you will build code to effect comparisons between groups of text data, using the ideas learned in reading and lecture.\n",

    "Typically we would use TF-IDF to find unique tokens in documents. Unfortunately, we either have too few documents (if we view each data source as a single document) or too many (if we view each description as a separate document). In the latter case, our problem will be that descriptions tend to be short, so our matrix would be too sparse to support analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these problems, we will create a custom statistic to identify words that are uniquely related to each corpus. The idea is to find words that occur often in one corpus and infrequently in the other(s). Since corpora can be of different lengths, we will focus on the _concentration_ of tokens within a corpus. \"Concentration\" is simply the count of the token divided by the total corpus length. For instance, if a corpus had length 100,000 and a word appeared 1,000 times, then the concentration would be $\\frac{1000}{100000} = 0.01$. If the same token had a concentration of $0.005$ in another corpus, then the concentration ratio would be $\\frac{0.01}{0.005} = 2$. Very rare words can easily create infinite ratios, so you will also add a cutoff to your code so that a token must appear at least $n$ times for you to return it. \n",
