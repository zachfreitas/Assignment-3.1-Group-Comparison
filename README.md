## ADS 509: Group Comparison

The task of comparing two groups of text is fundamental to textual analysis. There are innumerable applications: survey respondents from different segments of customers, speeches by different political parties, words used in Tweets by different constituencies, etc. In this assignment you will build code to effect comparisons between groups of text data, using the ideas learned in reading and lecture.   

This assignment asks you to analyze the lyrics and Twitter descriptions for the two artists you selected in Module 1. If the results from that pull were not to your liking, you are welcome to use the zipped data from the “Assignment Materials” section. 

Instructions: 

1. Create a repository under your GitHub account from this template: https://github.com/37chandler/ads-tm-api-scrape. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Make your repository public or add your instructor’s Github account as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). 
1. If you did not complete the assignment for Module 1, download “M1 Assignment Data.zip” from Blackboard and extract it into your repository. If you did complete the assignment for Module 1, then you will use that data in this assignment.  
1. The notebook “Group Comparison.ipynb” holds detailed instructions for the assignment. In that notebook you are asked to do the following: 
    
    * Read in the data, normalize the text, and tokenize it. When you tokenize your Twitter descriptions, keep hashtags and emojis in your token set.
    * Calculate descriptive statistics on the two sets of lyrics and compare the results.
    * For each of the four corpora, find the words that are unique to that corpus.
    * Build word clouds for all four corpora.

1. Work through the notebook, performing the steps asked of you. Use and extend the code from the chapters of your textbook.

Assignment Materials: 
  
* Group Comparison Repository
* (Optional) M1 Assignment Data.zip

Deliverables:

* When you have finished your code, print your notebook as a PDF and upload this document to Blackboard. 
* Commit your code and push the changes to GitHub so your instructor has access to the ipynb notebook file and any other code you create.
